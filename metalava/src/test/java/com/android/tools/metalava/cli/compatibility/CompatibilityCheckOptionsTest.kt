Compatibility Checks:

  Options controlling which, if any, compatibility checks are performed against a previously released API.

  --check-compatibility:base <file>          When performing a compat check, use the provided signature file as a base
                                             api, which is treated as part of the API being checked. This allows us to
                                             compute the full API surface from a partial API surface (e.g. the current
                                             @SystemApi txt file), which allows us to recognize when an API is moved
                                             from the partial API to the base API and avoid incorrectly flagging this
