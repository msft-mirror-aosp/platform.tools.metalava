Api Selection:

  Options that select which parts of the source files will be part of the generated API.

  --show-annotation <annotation-filter>      Unhide any hidden elements that are also annotated with the given
                                             annotation.
  --show-single-annotation <annotation-filter>
                                             Like --show-annotation, but does not apply to members; these must also be
                                             explicitly annotated.
  --show-for-stub-purposes-annotation <annotation-filter>
                                             Like --show-annotation, but elements annotated with it are assumed to be
                                             "implicitly" included in the API surface, and they'll be included in
                                             certain kinds of output such as stubs, but not in others, such as the
                                             signature file and API lint.
