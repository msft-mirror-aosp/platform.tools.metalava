/**
 * Returns the internal name of the type, as seen in bytecode.
 *
 * TODO(b/111253910): Look into moving this back to [TypeItem]. This was moved here because
 *   [toSlashFormat] depends on the lint class [ClassContext] and the model package cannot depend on
 *   lint classes. The proper type support can almost implement this without using [ClassContext] in
 *   which case it might make sense to move this back to [TypeItem]. One issue with
 *   [ClassContext.getInternalName] is that it uses a heuristic to determine whether something is a
 *   class or a package. Proper support for handling types could certainly do a better job.
