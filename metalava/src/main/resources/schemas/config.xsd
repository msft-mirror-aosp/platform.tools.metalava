 ! Schema for a configuration file supplied to Metalava with the `‐‐config-file` option.
 !
 ! While this is used at runtime to validate config files during parsing its main purpose is for use by editors to
 ! provide support for editing configuration files, e.g. providing auto-completion, validation while typing, etc.
 !
 ! As any element defined as a child of <xs:schema> can be used as a root element, which would often result in an
 ! invalid document this only creates a single such element. For other elements it defines them where they are used in
 ! terms of a top level <xs:complexType>. That prevents them from being used as root element while limiting the nested
 ! depth of this file. That is a common approach and in fact is used in the XMLSchema that applies to this file.
 !
 ! Elements use lower case, hyphenated names. Types use camel case names that start with an upper case letter to
 ! differentiate them.
