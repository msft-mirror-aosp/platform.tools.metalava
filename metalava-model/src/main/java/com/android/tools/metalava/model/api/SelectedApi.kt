     *
     * **Why this is needed:** When a class belongs to a narrower API surface than its super class
     * (e.g. a public class extending a `SystemApi` class), the class must also be included in the
     * wider API surface so that the type hierarchy in the wider API surface remains complete and
     * consistent. Tracking these variants separately from [contentApiVariants] (which tracks
     * variants from child items) allows distinguishing between variants introduced by enclosed
     * members and those introduced by the class hierarchy.
     *
     * **How it is set:** Initialized for [ClassItem]s in
     * [ClassSelectedApi.itemSpecificInitialization]. If the class has a super class whose narrowest
     * API surface is wider than this class's widest API surface, the super class's variants are
     * masked to match this class's variant types (e.g. only inherit `system(C)` if this class has
     * `public(C)`) and added to this set.
