 * This is used to provide contextual information about the name based on where it is used. e.g.
 * * in `@see <reference>`, the `<reference>` can refer to any [ReferencableItem] so is classified
 *   as [NameClassification.AMBIGUOUS].
 * * in `@see <qualifier>.<simple-name>`, the `<qualifier>` can refer only to [ReferencableItem]s
 *   that can qualify another name, i.e. [PackageItem] or [ClassItem]s.
 * * in `@throws <reference>`, the `<reference>` can refer only to a named type, i.e. [ClassItem] or
 *   [TypeParameterItem] so is classified as [NameClassification.TYPE].
