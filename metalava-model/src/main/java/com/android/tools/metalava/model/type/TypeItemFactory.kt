/**
 * Factory for building [TypeItem] from the underlying model specific representation of the type.
 *
 * The purpose of this is to abstract away all the model specific details of type construction in a
 * consistent manner across the models so that the types can be constructed in a consistent manner.
 * It provides specialist functions for different type uses that can ensure the specific constraints
 * of those type uses are enforced. e.g. types used for super class and interfaces cannot be
 * nullable.
 *
 * At the moment the specialist functions are limited to just a few different types but over time it
 * will be expanded as more type creation logic is moved inside.
 *
 * @param T the underlying model specific representation of a type.
 * @param I the model specific specialization of [TypeItem].
 * @param F the type of the factory implementation.
