     * Modifier meaning does depend on the [Item] to which they belong, e.g. just because `final`
     * and `deprecated` are `false` does not mean that the [Item] is not final or deprecated as the
     * containing class may be final or deprecated.
     *
     * It is used for:
     * * Checking method overrides.
     * * Checking consistent of classes whose definition is split across multiple signature files.
     * * Testing the [InheritableItem.duplicate] works correctly.
     *
     * @param owner the optional [Item] that owns this [ModifierList] and which is used to tweak the
     *   check to make it take into account the content within which they are being used. If it is
     *   not provided then this will just compare modifiers like for like.
     *
     * TODO(b/356548977): Currently, [owner] only has an effect if it is a [MethodItem]. That is due
     *   to it historically only being used for method overrides. However, as the previous list
     *   shows that is no longer true so it will need to be updated to correctly handle the other
     *   cases.
