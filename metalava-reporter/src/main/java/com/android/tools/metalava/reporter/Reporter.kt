     * 1. If the item is suppressed (see [isSuppressed]) then it will only be reported to a file
     *    into which suppressed issues are reported and this will return `false`.
     * 2. If possible the issue will be checked in a relevant baseline file to see if it is a known
     *    issue and if so it will simply be ignored.
     * 3. Otherwise, it will be reported at the appropriate severity to the command output and if
     *    possible it will be recorded in a new baseline file that the developer can copy to silence
     *    the issue in the future.
     *
     * If no [location] or [reportable] is provided then no location is reported in the error
     * message, and the baseline file is neither checked nor updated.
     *
     * If a [location] is provided but no [reportable] then it is used both to report the message
     * and as the baseline key to check and update the baseline file.
     *
     * If an [reportable] is provided but no [location] then it is used both to report the message
     * and as the baseline key to check and update the baseline file.
     *
     * If both an [reportable] and [location] are provided then the [reportable] is used as the
     * baseline key to check and update the baseline file and the [location] is used to report the
     * message. The reason for that is the [location] is assumed to be a more accurate indication of
     * where the problem lies but the [reportable] is assumed to provide a more stable key to use in
     * the baseline as it will not change simply by adding and removing lines in the containing
     * file.
     *
     * @param id the id of the issue.
     * @param reportable the optional object for which the issue is reported.
     * @param message the message to report.
     * @param location the optional location to specify.
     * @param maximumSeverity the maximum [Severity] that will be reported. An issue that is
     *   configured to have a higher [Severity] that this will use the [maximumSeverity] instead.
     * @return true if the issue was reported false it is a known issue in a baseline file.
