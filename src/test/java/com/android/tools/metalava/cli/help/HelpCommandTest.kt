Usage: metalava help package-filters

  Explains the syntax and behavior of package filters used in options like --stub-packages.

  A package filter is specified as a sequence of package matchers, separated by `:`. A matcher consists of an option
  leading `+` or `-` following by a pattern. If `-` is specified then it will exclude all packages that match the
  pattern, otherwise (i.e. with `+` or without either) it will include all packages that match the pattern. If a package
  is matched by multiple matchers then the last one wins.

  Patterns can be one of the following:

  `*` - match every package.

  `<package>` - an exact match, e.g. `foo` will only match `foo` and `foo.bar` will only match `foo.bar`.

  `<package>*` - a prefix match, e.g. `foo*` will match `foo` and `foobar` and `foo.bar`.

  `<package>.*` - a recursive match, will match `<package>` and any nested packages, e.g. `foo.*` will match `foo` and
  `foo.bar` and `foo.bar.baz` but not `foobar`.

Usage: metalava help signature-file-formats

  Describes the different signature file formats.

  See `FORMAT.md` in the top level metalava directory for more information.

  Conceptually, a signature file format is a set of properties that determine the types of information that will be
  output to the API signature file and how it is represented. A format version is simply a set of defaults for those
  properties.

  The supported properties are:

  * `kotlin-style-nulls = yes|no` - if `no` then the signature file will use `@Nullable` and `@NonNull` annotations to
  indicate that the annotated item accepts `null` and does not accept `null` respectively and neither indicates that
  it's not defined.

  If `yes` then the signature file will use a type suffix of `?`, no type suffix and a type suffix of `!` to indicate
  the that the type accepts `null`, does not accept `null` or it's not defined respectively.

  * `concise-default-values = yes|no` - if `no` then Kotlin parameters that have a default value will include that value
  in the signature file. If `yes` then those parameters will simply be prefixed with `optional`, as if it was a keyword
  and no value will be included.

  Currently, metalava supports the following versions:

  * `2.0` (--format=v2) - this is the base version (more details in `FORMAT.md`) on which all the others are based. It
  sets the properties as follows:

  + kotlin-style-nulls = no
  + concise-default-values = no

  * `3.0` (--format=v3) - this is `2.0` plus `kotlin-style-nulls = yes` giving the following properties:

  + kotlin-style-nulls = yes
  + concise-default-values = no

  * `4.0` (--format=v4) - this is 3.0` plus `concise-default-values = yes` giving the following properties:

  + kotlin-style-nulls = yes
  + concise-default-values = yes

  The `--api-overloaded-method-order` option also affects the contents in the signature file, i.e. whether overloaded
  methods are sorted based on their source order or purely based on their signature. However, it is orthogonal to a
  specific version and should be considered as purely a temporary measure, provided to aid migration and as such will be
  removed at some time in future.
