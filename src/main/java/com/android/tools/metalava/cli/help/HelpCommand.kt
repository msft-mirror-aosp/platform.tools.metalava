Explains the syntax and behavior of package filters used in options like $ARG_STUB_PACKAGES.

A package filter is specified as a sequence of package matchers, separated by `:`. A matcher
consists of an option leading `+` or `-` following by a pattern. If `-` is specified then it will
exclude all packages that match the pattern, otherwise (i.e. with `+` or without either) it will
include all packages that match the pattern. If a package is matched by multiple matchers then the
last one wins.

Patterns can be one of the following:

`*` - match every package.

`<package>` - an exact match, e.g. `foo` will only match `foo` and `foo.bar` will only match
`foo.bar`.

`<package>*` - a prefix match, e.g. `foo*` will match `foo` and `foobar` and `foo.bar`.

`<package>.*` - a recursive match, will match `<package>` and any nested packages, e.g. `foo.*`
will match `foo` and `foo.bar` and `foo.bar.baz` but not `foobar`.

Describes the different signature file formats.

See `FORMAT.md` in the top level metalava directory for more information.

Conceptually, a signature file format is a set of properties that determine the types of information
that will be output to the API signature file and how it is represented. A format version is simply
a set of defaults for those properties.

The supported properties are:

* `kotlin-style-nulls = yes|no` - if `no` then the signature file will use `@Nullable` and `@NonNull`
  annotations to indicate that the annotated item accepts `null` and does not accept `null`
  respectively and neither indicates that it's not defined.

  If `yes` then the signature file will use a type suffix of `?`, no type suffix and a type suffix
  of `!` to indicate the that the type accepts `null`, does not accept `null` or it's not defined
  respectively.

* `concise-default-values = yes|no` - if `no` then Kotlin parameters that have a default value will
  include that value in the signature file. If `yes` then those parameters will simply be prefixed
  with `optional`, as if it was a keyword and no value will be included.

Currently, metalava supports the following versions:

* `2.0` ($ARG_FORMAT=v2) - this is the base version (more details in `FORMAT.md`) on which all the
  others are based. It sets the properties as follows:
```
+ kotlin-style-nulls = no
+ concise-default-values = no
```

* `3.0` ($ARG_FORMAT=v3) - this is `2.0` plus `kotlin-style-nulls = yes` giving the following
properties:
```
+ kotlin-style-nulls = yes
+ concise-default-values = no
```

* `4.0` ($ARG_FORMAT=v4) - this is 3.0` plus `concise-default-values = yes` giving the following
properties:
```
+ kotlin-style-nulls = yes
+ concise-default-values = yes
```

The `$ARG_API_OVERLOADED_METHOD_ORDER` option also affects the contents in the signature file, i.e.
whether overloaded methods are sorted based on their source order or purely based on their
signature. However, it is orthogonal to a specific version and should be considered as purely a
temporary measure, provided to aid migration and as such will be removed at some time in future.
